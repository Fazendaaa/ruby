>"Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming." [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/)

## Why Ruby?

>"For the most part, Ruby took Perl's string processing and Unix integration as-is, meaning the syntax is identical, and so right there, before anything else happens, you already have the Best of Perl. And that's a great start, especially if you don't take the Rest of Perl." [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-ruby/)

As Jeff said before, Ruby is simmilar with Perl. Since I had a little time to spent with Perl chose Ruby to be my new langague to learn was not diffcult.

I was looking for a simple, a pretty much "english like" programming languague. The options that I was stuck with was Python or Ruby.

A friends said to try Ruby and I started with **[Learn Ruby The Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org)**, seing that's a great series to start reading once you know a little about programming. The material is in folder _the_hard_way_.

## Project Euler

Projects that I found to be one of the most interesting for those who want to do something in a new language.
